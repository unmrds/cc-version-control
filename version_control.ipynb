    "# Version Control\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most general sense, version control _can be_ any systematic means of tracking changes to files and folders. Depending on the scope of a project, the importance of a particular document, how many collaborators we have and how distributed the team is, we have all implemented various types of informal and formal version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often through experience, we learn the pros and cons of different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Folder & File Naming Conventions\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing standardized and agreed upon folder and file naming conventions is the simplest approach to version control and is a good practice under any circumstances. \n",

    "## Change Tracking\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Different applications and platforms provide change tracking tools which can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* detail who changed what, when (accountability and chronology)\n",
    "* support conflict resolution by manually accepting specific changes\n",
    "* tag, save, and restore/revert to previous versions\n",
    "\n",
    "But tracking changes in this fashion doesn't always scale well. Even with timestamping and identifying who made which changes, too many collaborators on a single document can result in confusion:\n",

    "## Software Version Control\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more specific sense, when we speak of version control we're referring to software version control typically used to manage revisions to source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Git website provides an overview of the evolution of different types of version control systems: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). Our focus today is on distributed version control systems (VCS), and Git in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of (D)VCS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code trees or file sets in DVCS systems can be managed across multiple copies or instances of a single repository. Edits are typically made to a local copy of the repository and pushed to the remote, master copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "VCS workflows simplify change tracking and conflict resolution. For supported file types, the complete history of every file is stored within the master and each instance of a repository. Branching, merging, and pull requests facilitate more complex workflows among large groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Every edit by every contributor is documented with annotations.\n"
