    "# Git and GitHub\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of GitHub's popularity, Git and GitHub may be confused as two aspects of a single application or platform. However, they are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a free and open source DVCS application that is supported by all major platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a widely adopted web application which overlays some useful project management features on top of an underlying Git engine. These features include wikis, issue management, integration with third party APIs, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, similar platforms such as GitLab exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the appropriate version of Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some configuration is necessary - we will define the necessary attributes below when we initialize a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a GitHub Account and Demo Repository\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using GitHub for our tutorial today, so if you do not already have a GitHub account please follow the instructions below to create one. Note that a basic account is free, but the free account does not include private repositories. That is, any repository created using a free account is automatically publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide a username and password where prompted.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-1.png](./images/github-1.png)\n",
    "2. Select a plan - as noted the basic plan is free. For our purposes today we will not set up an organization at this time.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-2.png](./images/github-2.png)\n",
    "3. For today's purposes we will skip the next step.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-3.png](./images/github-3.png)\n",
    "4. A verification email will be sent to the email address provided in step 1. Please check your email and click the link to provide verfication.\n",
    "5. The _Hello World Guide_ is very handy. We will not look at it today, but for future reference it can be accessed at [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).\n",
    "6. Click the button to _Start a project_.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-4.png](./images/github-4.png)\n",
    "7. Fill out the form to create a new repository. As noted, all repositories for free accounts are public. Additionally:\n",
    "    * Check the box to initilialize the repository with a README file.\n",
    "    * Add a _.gitignore_ file and select a file type from the list provided (for demo purposes you can select anything).\n",
    "    * Select a license from the dropdown menu provided.\n",
    "    * Click the button to _Create repository_ when done.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-5.png](./images/github-5.png)\n",
    "8. Note that the new repository comes with a _.gitignore_, _LICENSE_, and _README.md_ file. The contents of the README are output to the main repository page. Note the README file type is Markdown ('.md'), which is popular format for publishing structured text online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling the discussion about what a distributed VCS is, it's important to note that the GitHub instance of the repository is what we will refer to from here on as the _origin_. We will not be editing files directly on origin. Instead, we will clone a copy of the repository to a local workstation or laptop. This will be referred to as the local copy, and all edits or changes will be made locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the repository is initiated with a _master_ branch. Don't confuse the master branch with the origin repository - it's easy to do at first but the distinction is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make a Local Clone of the Repository\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactions with remote repositories often require authentication via HTTPS or SSH protocols. Secure shell (SSH) is preferred but requires creating and registering keys. This process is well documented at [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key), but for today we will use HTTPS authentication. This allows us to clone the repository and push commits using our GitHub usernames and passwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "From you computer, launch the Git command line client. As noted above, Git and GitHub are two different applications, so Git is not yet aware of our GitHub credentials or repository. Likewise, GitHub has no linkage with our local email account, identity, etc. Some of this linkage will be established when we clone the repository created above, but first some basic Git configuration is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start and configure Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is configured by default with several global parameters, for example the default text editor to open files. However, two parameters must be manually set - email and user name. Note that these DO NOT have to be the same as were used to create your GitHub account above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"You Email\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on configuration is available in the online reference: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config). You can also show help for any command using the `--help` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-1.png](./images/git-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clone the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to the repository on GitHub, select the button to _Clone or download_. Leave the default option to **Clone with HTTPS** and copy the URL to your clipboard. (Hint - in Windows you can right click the top bar of the command line window for edit commands.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-2.png](./images/git-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command in the Git command line client to download a clone of the repository to your local machine, where *your_repository_url* is replaced with the URL just copied to your clipboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://your_repository_url\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-3.png](./images/git-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The download should begin immediately. Because our repositories are public, you may not be asked to authenticate. If you are asked to authenticate at any point, provide your GitHub username and password when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the clone command should look something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cloning into 'demo-repo'...\n",
    "remote: Counting objects: 7, done.\n",
    "remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.\n",
    "remote: Total 7 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n",
    "Unpacking objects: 100% (7/7), done.\n",
    "Checking connectivity... done.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding make sure to change directory into the repository. Use the `cd` command and the name of the directory, which should be the name of the repository (with hyphens for spaces). Since my repository is called 'demo repo,' I will change into it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd demo-repo`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have changed directories, you can use the list command, `ls` or `ls -a`, to view the contents of the repository. These should be exactly the same as what we have on the GitHub copy of the repository (the origin), with the addition of a hidden `.git` directory. Do not remove or make changes to the `.git` directory - it is essentially the version control 'engine' for the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-4.png](./images/git-4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If at this time you would like to navigate to the repository using your local machine's file management GUI (Windows Explorer, etc.) but are unsure where it is on your system, in the command line you can use the `pwd` command (for _present working directory_) to show the full path to the repository."

    "### 3. A common workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have created a repository (the 'origin') on GitHub and cloned it to our local workstation. We can use the `git status` command to verify this. We'll be using the `git status` command frequently to check on the state of our local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-5.png](./images/git-5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to reset or set the connection to the source repository on GitHub, this can be done manually. In the case of our demo repository, the command would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add origin https://github.com/jerseyjw/demo-repo.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage a file for snapshotting with `git add`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will create a simple file with some formatted text. We will use the Markdown syntax and file type. Writing Markdown doesn't require any special software, but uses a structure and syntax that GitHub understands (remember our README file is in Markdown format).\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the file can be done various ways, but the simplest method is to use the `touch` command in the command line shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "`touch hello.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an empty file but doesn't open it for editing. We can verify the file has been created using the `ls` command. We can also run `git status` for information about the state of the repository now that we have made a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-6.png](./images/git-6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a text editor, add some text to our new file, `hello.md`. For something with a little Markdown goodness, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Saying Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now save and close the file. Use the `git add` command to stage the file for the next snapshot of the local repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add hello.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Add` is one of the most commonly used Git commands, and there are many flags and options for adding multiple files at one time, and simultaneously adding and committing files. Depending on your operating system and the text editor used to create the file, you may get some output relating to whitespace compression or something similar. That's not an error and may be ignored for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's run `git status` again:\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-7.png](./images/git-7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our `hello.md` file which was previously listed as 'untracked' is now included among 'Changes to be committed.' That is, the file has been staged for the repository snapshot that will be created the next time we run the `git commit` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Take a snapshot of the repository with `git commit`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have still not uploaded or made any changes to the source or origin repository on GitHub. This is because with Git we don't necessarily upload individual files to the repository, we upload a snapshot of the _state_ of the repository. The distinction is crucial - the state of the repository includes not only new files and changes made to existing files, but deletions, new directories, moved files, etc. ANY change made to the repository is included within a snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that earlier we mentioned annotation, and that snapshots (or _commits_) include descriptive or explanatory comments. There are various ways to add comments, but the easiest is to use the `-m` flag to add an inline comment when `git commit` is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -m \"adding a Hello World example\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to include quotes around the message!\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-8.png](./images/git-8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Push changes to the source or origin repository using `git push`\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted, when we want to update the source repository on GitHub, we do so by pushing snapshots (commits) rather than individual files. When we push commits, Git needs to know which remote repository and branch we are pushing to. As noted when we first ran `git status`, the remote repository is named 'origin.' Since we're still on the master or main branch, the command for pushing our changes is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git push -u origin master`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, and with every push, we will be required to authenticate. Since we're using HTTPS, we need to provide our GitHub usernames and passwords. **PLEASE NOTE:** Command line shells typically do not 'echo' passwords using asterisks, spaces, etc. That is, the cursor won't move when entering passwords, so type carefully!\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. View updates to the GitHub repository\n",
    "\n",
    "If we return to GitHub and refresh our repository, we see our new file with some additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-10.png](./images/git-10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "and repeat!\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that large, distributed projects with a lot of contributors don't always run smoothly (and some small projects with a handful of contributors don't run smoothly either!). In a future workshop we will cover Git commands and features that support more robust workflows, especially branching, merging, and steps for resolving conflicts between commits. In the meantime, the following resources are well worth exploring when questions arise:\n",

    "\n",
    "That said, a few more commands are good to know right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update a local repository using `git pull`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working with collaborators, keep in mind that they will be committing their own changes to the source repository. To avoid conflicts, it's a good idea to update your local copy of the repository with those changes using the `pull` command. As with `push`, it's good to specify the remote repository and branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since no changes have been made to our example repository, the output indicates that our local repository is up to date:\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-12.png](./images/git-12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Show changes between commits with `git diff`\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a few minutes to make additional edits to `hello.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git status` to view the state of the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-13.png](./images/git-13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notifies us that a file has changed, but we can view the changes themselves using `diff`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git diff`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a line has been deleted and three lines added:\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-14.png](./images/git-14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now stage and commit the changes, and check the status of the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add hello.md\n",
    "git commit -m \"adding some text to hello example\"\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "This time the output of the status command indicates that we have one commit in our local repository that has not been pushed to the source repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-15.png](./images/git-15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each commit is assigned a hash or identifier. We can use these hashes to compare the current commit with any previous commit. The easiest way to view these identifiers is to use the `log` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git log`\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives the following output. The hashes are the long strings following the word 'commit':\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-16.png](./images/git-16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare commits, we generally only need the first six or seven characters of the corresponding hashes. Using the hashes from the example, to compare the current or most recent commit with the previous one, all we need is the hash of the previous commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git diff e3fbaa6`\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-17.png](./images/git-17.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "`git diff` will show changes to multiple files and directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-18.png](./images/git-18.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the basic workflow described above, `git pull`, `git diff`, and `git log` are important commands to get the hang of quickly to avoid conflicts and keep track of documented changes to the repository state."
