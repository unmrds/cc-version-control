    "# Git and GitHub\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of GitHub's popularity, Git and GitHub may be confused as two aspects of a single application or platform. However, they are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a free and open source DVCS application that is supported by all major platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://git-scm.com/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a widely adopted web application which overlays some useful project management features on top of an underlying Git engine. These features include wikis, issue management, integration with third party APIs, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "<https://github.com/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, similar platforms such as GitLab exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the appropriate version of Git from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some configuration is necessary - we will define the necessary attributes below when we initialize a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start and configure Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is configured by default with several global parameters, for example the default text editor to open files. However, parameters can be set manually, and two must be - email and user name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"You Email\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on configuration is available in the online reference: <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config>. You can also show help for any command using the `--help` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the --`list` flag with `git config` to view information about other configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --list`\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that Git is configured, we can create a repository and start tracking files. We can use our home directory or desktop:\n",

    "### 3. A common workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have configured Git and created a local repository. We can use the `git status` command to verify that we do in fact have a repository, and as we move forward we'll be using the `git status` command frequently to check on the state of our local repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage a file for snapshotting with `git add`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will create a simple file with some formatted text. We will use the Markdown syntax and file type. Writing Markdown doesn't require any special software, but uses a structure and syntax that GitHub understands. This lets us include HTML-type formatting for when we connect our repository to GitHub later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the file can be done various ways, but the simplest method is to use the `touch` command in the command line shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "`touch README.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an empty file but doesn't open it for editing. We can verify the file has been created using the `ls` command. We can also run `git status` for information about the state of the repository now that we have made a change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "\n",
    "        README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a text editor, add some text to our new file, `README.md`. For something with a little Markdown syntax, try:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Demo Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting our feet wet with Git and GitHub.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now save and close the file. Run `git status` to see how this new file is recognized by git. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "Use the `git add` command to stage the file for the next snapshot of the local repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add README.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Add` is one of the most commonly used Git commands, and there are many flags and options for adding multiple files at one time, and simultaneously adding and committing files. Depending on your operating system and the text editor used to create the file, you may get some output relating to line endings and whitespace. It's not an error, and Git can be configured to handle line endings differently as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's run `git status` again:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our `README.md` file which was previously listed as 'untracked' is now included among 'Changes to be committed.' That is, the file has been staged for the repository snapshot that will be created the next time we run the `git commit` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Take a snapshot of the repository with `git commit`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have still not updated the history of our repository by \"committing\" our staged changes. Each `git commit` creates a snapshot of the repository that reflects the previous state of the repository plus any changes that have been added through the `git add` command. Any other changes will not yet be reflected in any git snapshots. You can continue to run `git add` on changed files in your repository until all changes have been added and committed. This allows you to group changes that you want to commit together (for example changes in a set of related files) enabling targeted documentation of the reasons for making specific changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that earlier we mentioned annotation, and that snapshots (or _commits_) include descriptive or explanatory comments. There are various ways to add comments - here we will use the `-m` flag to add an inline comment when `git commit` is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -m \"adding a README file\"\n",
    "```\n",
