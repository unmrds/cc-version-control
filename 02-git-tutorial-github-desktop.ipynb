    "# Git and GitHub\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of GitHub's popularity, Git and GitHub may be confused as two aspects of a single application or platform. However, they are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a free and open source DVCS application that is supported by all major platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<https://git-scm.com/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a widely adopted web application which overlays some useful project management features on top of an underlying Git engine. These features include wikis, issue management, integration with third party APIs, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "<https://github.com/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, similar platforms such as GitLab exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install GitHub Desktop\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the appropriate version of the GitHub Desktop application from \n",
    "<https://desktop.github.com/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the _File_ menu, select _Options_:\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/desktop-1.png](./images/desktop-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the _Accounts_ tab, sign into your GitHub account as needed. Use the same credentials that you use to log into GitHub online.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/desktop-2.png](./images/desktop-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify your name and email address in the _Git_ tab. Make sure the default branch for new repositories is set to **main.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/desktop-3.png](./images/desktop-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also look at the settings in the other tabs. In most cases the default setting will be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Optional) Install and configure Git\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are only going to use GitHub, the desktop application we just installed and configured \n",
    "provides all of the features you need, including a working version of Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use other Git services such as LoboGit (<https://lobogit.unm.edu/>), you may need to\n",
    "install a standalone version of Git. The Windows installer from the Git website provides additional tools,\n",
    "including a Git bash client for using Git from the command line, and some graphical tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the appropriate version of Git from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some configuration is necessary. Git is configured by default with several global parameters, for example the default text editor to open files. However, parameters can be set manually, and two must be - email and user name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"You Email\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on configuration is available in the online reference: <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config>. You can also show help for any command using the `--help` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the --`list` flag with `git config` to view information about other configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --list`\n",
