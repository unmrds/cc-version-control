    "In our previous Git workshop, we used GitHub to host repositories. This time, we will work with LoboGit, a UNM Libraries branded instance of the GitLab platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "More info about GitLab is available from the website: [https://about.gitlab.com/](https://about.gitlab.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "LoboGit can be accessed at [https://lobogit.unm.edu/](https://lobogit.unm.edu/). Log in using your standard UNM NetId and password.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once signed in, create a new repository using the _New Project_ button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 1](./images/lobogit-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects have a namespace and a name. The default namespace is your username, in this case NetID. If you are a member of any groups in LoboGit, you may also have the option to use group names as the namespace. Doing so would automatically add group members to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project name can be almost any text. Avoid spaces and special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visibility level can be set to any of the available options. One benefit of using LoboGit over GitHub is that you can leverage UNM's identity management system to define who you share your repository with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend always initializing a repository with a README as that will streamline the process of cloning the repository into your local system.\n",
    "\n",
    "When ready, hit the _Create Blank Project_ button.\n",

    "## Git Ignore\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Git tracks changes to all files in a repository. From the root repository directory on down, every folder and file is watched for changes. There are many use cases where this _may_ not be desirable or efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large files\n",
    "* Multimedia, binary file types, etc. \n",
    "* Ancillary files and data\n",
    "* Logfiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Files, file types, and directories (with any subdirectories) can be excluded from tracking by adding them to the '.gitignore' file. Info about the ignore file is available in the **Pro Git** book and [online documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that '.gitignore' is a hidden file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike GitHub, GitLab/LoboGit does not presently offer an option to create the '.gitignore' file when the repository is created. We can create one easily enough. From the root directory of the repository, create the file using the `touch` command. We will also write some text to a new file to use for the first example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "touch .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Move along. Nothing to see here\" > ignoreThis.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"ignoreThis.txt\" >> .gitignore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ignore file can then be edited using your preferred text editor. It is possible to ignore individual files by name, but wildcards can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first let's edit '.gitignore' to add 'ignoreThis.txt.'\n",
    "\n",
    "![gitignore](./images/gitignore.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage changes to the repository using `git add .`, then check using `git status`. Notice that 'ignoreThis.txt' is not include among the set of changes to be committed:\n",
    "\n",
    "![git add/git status](./images/git_add_status.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also verify that a file is ignored using `git ls-files`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![git ls-files](./images/git_ls-files.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, ignoring one file at a time is not efficient. Within the ignore file, we can also specify patterns and directories ([Git documentation for .gitignore patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format)). Note that subdirectories of ignored directories are also ignored. Some useful patterns might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# We are going to generate a lot of text files. Do not track any.\n",
    "\n",
    "*.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Match patterns relative to the .gitignore file location, or anywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "/foo            # matches directories or files named \"foo\" in the top of the repo\n",
    "foo             # matches directories or files named \"foo\" anywhere in the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ignore directories and their content specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "/foo/           # mathces only directories named \"foo\" in the top of the repo\n",
    "foo/            # matches only directories named \"foo\" anywhere in the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ignore all contents of directories\n",
    "\n",
    "ancillary_data/images/**\n",
    "md/**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add some additional rules to our `.gitignore` file:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![gitignore some more](./images/gitignore_some_more_02.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![add, commit, push master branch](./images/push_master_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then run the following script (`makefiles.sh`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Create a lot of files, some text, some Markdown\n",

    "## Branching and Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we have done all our work on a single, 'master' branch of the repository. Especially in production environments and as projects become more complex, multiple collaborators committing to a single branch will quickly lead to conflicts. This is where branches come in. In contrast to forks, which are discussed below, branches are relative to a repository: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating branches requires that you have editing permissions on the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can be managed (created/deleted) in the source repository. LoboGit (GitLab) for example, has a _New branch_ button in the _Branches_ tab of a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "![new branch in LoboGit](./images/lobogit_new_branch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can also be managed locally using the `git branch` command. When working with branches, we will also use the `git checkout` command: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout). We can create and checkout a branch at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout -b toMerge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![git checkout](./images/git_checkout.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a local branch allows us to experiment, test changes, etc. without affecting the master branch. For example, we can delete all of the text (`.txt`) files in the repository by creating a shell script that executres a handy `find` command (`removefiles.sh`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "!/usr/bin/env bash\n",
    "# delete all the .txt files\n",
    "find . -type f -name '*.txt' -exec rm {} +\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![find and delete text files](./images/find_delete.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Add, commit, and push:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Add, commit](./images/add_commit_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![push](./images/push_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to the source repository in LoboGit, the master branch does not reflect the deleted files. Note, also, that the most recent commit is not the one we just made to the 'toMerge' branch. In LoboGit you can switch between branches through the branch menu. \n",
    "\n",
    "![LoboGit Branch menu](./images/Lobogit_branches.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally, we can switch between branches (using `git checkout`):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Checkout the master branch](./images/checkout_master.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have pushed our branch to the remote repository in LoboGit. It's possible, however, to create and delete branches locally and exclude from snapshots committed to remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging commits into the master branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches provide a lot of flexibility for development, but at some point we may want or need to incorporate all the changes in a secondary branch into the master branch. This is done using `git merge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with managing branches, merging can be done at the remote using a web client or locally using git `git merge` command. My strong preference is to merge locally. The basic form of the command is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git merge [branch]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where _[branch]_ is the name of the branch that will be merged __into the currently checked out branch__. Prior to merging, be sure to check out the appropriate branch. In our case, that will be `master`. In our simple example, merging is a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "\n",
    "git merge toMerge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that merging by itself does not delete the branch. It is still there to be checked out for additional testing or experimenting as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Merge the toMerge branch into master](./images/merge_toMerge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resolving conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, merges would always be so simple. In practice, conflicts arise due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different people working on the same file/branch\n",
    "* An individual working from multiple devices\n",
    "* Changes to other branches\n",
    "\n",
    "and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our example, let's create a new `conflict` branch and edit `makefiles.sh` to create different numbers of files and change the directory structure that will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "![checkout our conflict branch](./images/checkout_conflict.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![make changes to the makefiles.sh file](./images/conflict_changes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Add` and `commit`. `Push` is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, while we were editing this file our colleagues were making their own changes in the master branch in the LoboGit web interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "![make changes to the makefiles.sh file in LoboGit](./images/Lobogit_changes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, we should have communicated better. But things happen, and we see the problems when we try to merge our `conflict` branch with the updated `master` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "![conflict happens](./images/conflict.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin fixing these conflicts, first we need some more specific detail. The `git diff` command diplays differences between commits. In our present case, the output of `git diff` is presented below. Note that in the command line client the output may be helpfully color-coded.\n",
    "\n",
    "![git diff](./images/git_diff.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then open the conflicted file (`makefiles.sh`) in an editor and update the file to reflect what the appropriate resolution of the conflict should be - including removing the conflict annotations that were added when we tried (and failed) to do a clean merge. \n",
    "\n",
    "![fix the conflict in an editor](./images/fix_conflict.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env bash\n",
    "# Create a lot of files, some text, some Markdown\n",
    "# Write files to different directories\n",
    "COUNTER=0\n",

    "mkdir ancillary_data/stuff\n",

    "    touch ancillary_data/file_0$COUNTER.txt\n",
    "    touch md/file_0$COUNTER.md\n",
    "    let COUNTER=COUNTER+1\n",
    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have made the appropriate changes, we finish resolving the conflicts using `git add` and `git commit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![finishing the conflicted merge](./images/resolved_add_commit_push.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resetting\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be necessary at times to roll back commits or revert the repository to a previous state. The `git reset` command offers multiple ways of doing this: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset can be used to 'unstage' files that have been staged for the next commit. This can be done for paths as well as individual files. In our case, having checked out the toMerge branch and done some work, we can use `git status` and `git add` to check and update the state of the local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the `makefiles.sh` file to create a new directory, and add files to that director:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Run `makefiles.sh` to generate some content in the new directory. Execute `git status` to see what the current changes are and run `git add` to stage those changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "![make some changes](./images/reset_make_changes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reset all of our added changes with `git reset .`\n",
    "\n",
    "![reset all changes](./images/reset_all_staged.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also reset a single file (or multiple files by listing them, or using wildcards), for example `makefiles.sh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![reset one staged file](./images/reset_one_staged.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of reset can also be done interactively, which allows you to accept or reject one change at a time. After staging the last set of changes, we add all changed files as before, and using the `git reset` with the `-p` (or `--patch`) flag, for each change we are presented with a prompt to keep or unstage it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![git reset patch option](./images/reset_patch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![git reset patch status](./images/reset_patch_status.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As above, resetting in this way can be done against a path or an individual file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now `git commit` our changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![git reset commit changes](./images/reset_commit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have looked at ways to reset the state of a repository by unstaging files that have been staged for the next commit. But there may be times when it's necessary to roll back an entire commit. The process is similar, but requires us to know the hash of the commit we want to revert to. We can get this info various way, but the easiest is to use `git log`. Depending on the number of commits, the output can be lengthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![git log](./images/git_log.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The hashes we're looking for are the long strings of numbers following the word 'commit.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git reset <commit hash>` command will reset the repository to the commit with the message 'resolving merge errors.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a simple reset like this will not delete changes that have been made to watched files since the target commit, as we can see from `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing changes requires the `--hard` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "![reset to a previous commit](./images/reset_to_commit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have only reset the local repository. As indicated by the status output, we pushed some commits to remote before resetting. This can result in conflicts later. The easiest solution is to use `git pull` as suggested. Alternatively, we can also proceed and resolve any conflicts as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forking and Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking a repository creates a _new_ repository. Forking is useful when you want to contribute changes to a repository to which you __do not__ have write permissions. Alternatively, forking allows you to use an existing repository as a starting point for some other product or idea (as permitted by the license and attribution requirements of the original repository).\n",
    "\n",
    "A fork is largely an independent copy of the source repository: [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Changes committed to the fork are __not__ automatically passed on to the original repository.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Working in a forked repository is no different from working in one which you created yourself. Everything covered so far applies. However, a fork of a repository can still communicate with the original. Let's say, for example, that someone forked our tutorial repository and decided to modify the 'makefiles.sh' script.
