    "Welcome and welcome back! Please note the notebooks for today's workshop have been added to the same repository as we used to present the introduction to Git and DVCS in December, 2017. Please feel free to refer to those materials for a refresher or background info. We may repeat some steps to get set up today, but generally we won't be going through those notebooks again. However, we are happy to answer any questions!\n",
