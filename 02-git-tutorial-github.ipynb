    "# Git and GitHub\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its popularity, Git and GitHub may be confused as two aspects of a single application or platform. However, they are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a free and open source DVCS application that is supported by all major platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is a widely adopted web application which overlays some useful project management features on top of an underlying Git engine. These features include wikis, issue management, integration with third party APIs, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "[https://github.com/](https://github.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other, similar platforms such as GitLab exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the appropriate version of Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some configuration is necessary - we will define the necessary attributes below when we initialize a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a GitHub Account and Demo Repository\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using GitHub for our tutorial today, so if you do not already have a GitHub account please follow the instructions below to create one. Note that a basic account is free, but the free account does not include private repositories. That is, any repository created using a free account is automatically publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide a username and password where prompted.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-1.png](./images/github-1.png)\n",
    "2. Select a plan - as noted the basic plan is free. For our purposes today we will not set up an organization at this time.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-2.png](./images/github-2.png)\n",
    "3. For today's purposes we will skip the next step.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-3.png](./images/github-3.png)\n",
    "4. A verification email will be sent to the email address provided in step 1. Please check your email and click the link to provide verfication.\n",
    "5. The _Hello World Guide_ is very handy. We will not look at it today, but for future reference it can be accessed at [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).\n",
    "6. Click the button to _Start a project_.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-4.png](./images/github-4.png)\n",
    "7. Fill out the form to create a new repository. As noted, all repositories for free accounts are public. Additionally:\n",
    "    * Check the box to initilialize the repository with a README file.\n",
    "    * Add a _.gitignore_ file and select a file type from the list provided (for demo purposes you can select anything).\n",
    "    * Select a license from the dropdown menu provided.\n",
    "    * Click the button to _Create repository_ when done.\n",
    "    ![./images/github-5.png](./images/github-5.png)\n",
    "8. Note that the new repository comes with a _.gitignore_, _LICENSE_, and _README.md_ file. The contents of the README are output to the main repository page. Note the README file type is Markdown ('.md'), which is popular format for publishing structured text online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling the discussion about what a distributed VCS is, it's important to note that the GitHub instance of the repository is what we will refer to from here on as the _origin_. We will not be editing files directly on origin. Instead, we will clone a copy of the repository to a local workstation or laptop. This will be referred to as the local copy, and all edits or changes will be made locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the repository is initiated with a _master_ branch. Don't confuse the master branch with the origin repository - it's easy to do at first but the distinction is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make a Local Clone of the Repository\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactions with remote repositories often require authentication via HTTPS or SSH protocols. Secure shell (SSH) is preferred but requires creating and registering keys. This process is well documented at [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key), but for today we will use HTTPS authentication. This allows us to clone the repository and push commits using our GitHub usernames and passwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "From you computer, launch the Git command line client. As noted above, Git and GitHub are two different applications, so Git is not yet aware of our GitHub credentials or repository. Likewise, GitHub has no linkage with our local email account, identity, etc. Some of this linkage will be established when we clone the repository created above, but first some basic Git configuration is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Start and configure Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is configured by default with several global parameters, for example the default text editor to open files. However, two parameters much be manually set - email and user name. Note that these DO NOT have to be the same as were used to create your GitHub account above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"You Email\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on configuration is available in the online reference: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config). You can also show help for any command using the `--help` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add --help`\n",
    "\n",
    "Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-1.png](./images/git-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clone the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to the repository on GitHub, select the button to _Clone or download_. Leave the default option to **Clone with HTTPS** and copy the URL to your clipboard. (Hint - in Windows you can right click the top bar of the command line window for edit commands.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-2.png](./images/git-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following command in the Git command line client to download a clone of the repository to your local machine, where *your_repository_url* is replaced with the URL just copied to your clipboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://your_repository_url\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![./images/git-3.png](./images/git-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The download should begin immediately. Because our repositories are public, you may not be asked to authenticate. If you are asked to authenticate at any point, provide your GitHub username and password when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the clone command should look something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cloning into 'demo-repo'...\n",
    "remote: Counting objects: 7, done.\n",
    "remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.\n",
    "remote: Total 7 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n",
    "Unpacking objects: 100% (7/7), done.\n",
    "Checking connectivity... done.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding make sure to change directory into the repository. Use the `cd` command and the name of the directory, which should be the name of the repository (with hyphens for spaces). Since my repository is called 'demo repo,' I will change into it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd demo-repo`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have changed directories, you can use the list command, `ls` or `ls -a`, to view the contents of the repository. These should be exactly the same as what we have on the GitHub copy of the repository (the origin), with the addition of a hidden `.git` directory. Do not remove or make changes to the `.git` directory - it is essentially the version control 'engine' for the repository."
