    "---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous Git workshop, we used GitHub to host repositories. This time, we will work with LoboGit, a UNM Libraries branded instance of the GitLab platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "More info about GitLab is available from the website: [https://about.gitlab.com/](https://about.gitlab.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "LoboGit can be accessed at [https://lobogit.unm.edu/](https://lobogit.unm.edu/). Log in using your standard UNM NetId and password.\n",

    "## Creating Repositories in LoboGit\n",
    "\n",
    "Once signed in, create a new repository using the _New Project_ button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 1](./images/lobogit-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects have a namespace and a name. The default namespace is your username, in this case NetID. If you are a member of any groups in LoboGit, you may also have the option to use group names as the namespace. Doing so would automatically add group members to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project name can be almost any text. Avoid spaces and special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visibility level can be set to any of the available options. One benefit of using LoboGit over GitHub is that private repositories are available for free to all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend always initializing a repository with a README.\n",
    "\n",
    "When ready, hit the _Create project_ button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 2](./images/lobogit-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on, steps for cloning the repository to your local environment and the basic workflow are the same as were covered in the previous workshop. As before, we will skip the generation of SSH keys and authenticate using HTTPS.\n",

    "## Git Ignore\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Git tracks changes to all files in a repository. From the root repository directory on down, every folder and file is watched for changes. There are many use cases where this _may_ not be desirable or efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large files\n",
    "* Multimedia, binary file types, etc. \n",
    "* Ancillary files and data\n",
    "* Logfiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Files, file types, and directories (with any subdirectories) can be excluded from tracking by adding them to the '.gitignore' file. Info about the ignore file is available in the **Pro Git** book and [online documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that '.gitignore' is a hidden file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike GitHub, GitLab/LoboGit does not presently offer an option to create the '.gitignore' file when the repository is created. We can create one easily enough. From the root directory of the repository, create the file using the `touch` command. We will also write some text to a new file to use for the first example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "touch .gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Move along. Nothing to see here\" > ignoreThis.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ignore file can then be edited using your preferred text editor. It is possible to ignore individual files by name, but wildcards can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first let's edit '.gitignore' to add 'ignoreThis.txt.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage changes to the repository using `git add .`, then check using `git status`. Notice that 'ignoreThis.txt' is not include among the set of changes to be committed:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 3](./images/lobogit-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also verify that a file is ignored using `git ls-files`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 4](./images/lobogit-4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, adding ignoring one file at a time is not efficient. Within the ignore file, we can also specify patterns and directories. Note that subdirectories of ignored directories are also ignored. A simple but more effective ignore file might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# We are going to generate a lot of text files. Do not track any.\n",
    "\n",
    "*.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ignore directories\n",
    "\n",
    "ancillary_data/images/**\n",
    "md/**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then run the following script ('generate_files.py'):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create a lot of files, some text, some Markdown\n",
    "# Write files to different directories\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(0, 100):\n",
    "    if i == 0:\n",
    "        with open(str(i) + '.md', 'w') as f:\n",
    "            f.write(\"Hello! This is file \" + str(i))\n",
    "    elif i >= 1 and i < 33:\n",
    "        with open(str(i) + '.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "            f.write(\"Hello! This is file \" + str(i))\n",
    "    elif i >= 33 and i < 66:\n",
    "        with open('./ancillary_data/' + str(i) + '.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "            f.write(\"Hello! This is file \" + str(i))\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        with open('./md/' + str(i) + '.md', 'w') as f:\n",
    "            f.write(\"Hello! This is file \" + str(i))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the outputs of `ls` and `git ls-files`:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Branches and Forking\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we have done all our work on a single, 'master' branch (trunk) of the repository. Especially in production environments and as projects become more complex, multiple collaborators committing to a single branch will quickly lead to conflicts. This is where branches and forking come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Branches__ are relative to a repository: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)\n",
    "* __Forking__ creates a _new_ repository. A fork is a largely independent copy of the source repository: [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This morning, we will mostly focus on branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can be managed (created/deleted) in the source repository. LoboGit (GitLab) for example, has a _New branch_ button in the _Branches_ tab of a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can also be managed locally using the `git branch` command. When working with branches, we will also use the `git checkout` command: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout). We can create and checkout a branch at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout -b toMerge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 6](./images/lobogit-6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a local branch allows us to experiment, test changes, etc. without affecting the master branch. For example, we can create a file, 'delete_text.py,' with the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Delete all text files in the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import fnmatch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for r, d, n in os.walk('.'):\n",
    "    for f in n:\n",
    "        p = os.path.join(r, f)\n",
    "        if fnmatch.fnmatch(f, '*.txt'):\n",
    "            os.remove(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add, commit, and push:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 7](./images/lobogit-7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to the source repository in LoboGit, the master branch does not include the new 'delete_text.py' file. Note, also, that the most recent commit is not the one we just made to the 'toMerge' branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 8](./images/lobogit-8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Locally, we can switch between branches (using `git checkout`) and compare using `ls` and `git ls-files`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lobogit 9](./images/lobogit-9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have pushed our branch to the remote repository in LoboGit. It's possible, however, to create and delete branches locally and exclude from snapshots committed to remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking, as noted above, creates a copy of the repository. By default, changes committed to the fork --even the master branch-- are not passed on to the original repository. The most straight-forward way to fork a repository is usually via the web client:\n",
